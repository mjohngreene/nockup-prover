                ℹ️ About Prover
                
                    Prover is a NockApp that accepts and tracks SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Proof) submissions.
                    Currently operating in local mode, storing submissions for future integration.
                
                
                    Coming Soon: Once Nockchain supports user-provided ZKP verification,
                    Prover will automatically submit proofs on-chain for verification and track results.
